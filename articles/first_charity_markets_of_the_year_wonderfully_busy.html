            <p>The first Centenary Park Charity Markets for 2023 took place on the 26th of February under the leadership of the local charity, Our Town Association Inc.</p>
            <p>The local charity took over responsibility for the monthly markets in Centenary Park after a previous organiser, Val Cragg passed away.</p>
            <p>Our Town Association Inc President, Jo Feirclough said the event was bustling with locals.</p>
            <p>“Wally and Val Cragg successfully ran the charity markets for 14 years,” Mrs Feirclough said.</p>
            <p>“The markets have now been entrusted to OTA .</p>
            <p>“We had a wonderfully busy 1st of the year markets, with some regulars and new stall holders.</p>
            <p>“We will be sharing our regular stall holders on our Centenary Park Charity Markets Facebook page.</p>
            <p>“We as a group are hoping to see a steady growth in the markets.</p>
            <p>“Our town has always been community minded so what better way to connect with old friends and make new ones than coming together at the markets.”</p>
