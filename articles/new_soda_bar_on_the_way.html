            <p>Whitbreads' Soft Drinks announced the expansion of their business in a now viral social media post uploaded to their official Facebook page.</p>
            <p>The expansion includes the acquisition of “The Northern Miner” building on Gill Street and the opening of a soda bar.</p>
            <p>Co-Owner of the over 120-year-old soft drink manufacturer, Ian Urquhart said the new soda bar will be a fitting amalgamation of two big components in Charters Towers history.</p>
            <p>“We are planning a soda shop so people can come in and try our drinks and increase foot traffic through the tourist season,” he said.</p>
            <p>“We have actually combined one of the oldest manufacturing buildings with one of the oldest manufacturing businesses in Charters Towers into one location.”</p>
            <p>“The Northern Miner” building on Gill Street is the former home of a now downsized news organisation.</p>
            <p>Whitbreads' Soft Drinks and Cordials has been located in Charters Towers since 1896.</p>
            <p>The new soda bar does not yet have a determined opening date.</p>
